Events can be easily defined either by defining a method to be an event handler or by providing a lambda. Each event handler will be executed in turn based upon their priority. Triggering an Event \u00b6 An event is derived from either GeyserEvent or CancellableGeyserEvent . Example public class MyCustomEvent extends GeyserEvent { } The event is triggered through the triggerEvent method of the Event Manager. Example eventManager . triggerEvent ( new MyCustomEvent ()); Listening to an Event \u00b6 There are two ways to listen for an event. One can either create an event handler method or one can create an anonymous lamda to be executed when the event is triggered. Class Event Handler \u00b6 An event handler method is a method that is annotated with @Event . The class it belongs to must also be registered with the event manager. Example public class MyClass { @Event public void onEnable ( EventContext ctx , MyCustomEvent event ) { System . err . println ( \"Hello World\" ); } } ... GeyserConnecter . getInstance (). getEventManager . registerEvents ( new MyClass ()); Important Plugins should use the registerEvents method inherited from GeyserPlugin . The @Event annotation has the following optional parameters: priority - Integer from 0 - 100. Default 50 . Event Handlers are executed in order from lowest to highest priority. ignoreCancelled - Boolean. Default true . If true then if an event is cancelled the handler will not be executed. The EventContext will be discussed later. MyCustomEvent is the event defined previously. Anonymous Lambda \u00b6 An event can be hooked through the on method of the EventManager provided with an anonymous function. This allows code to be placed logically close to where it is related in the code instead of having to set up a separate class and method listeners. Example GeyserConnector . getInstance (). getEventManager (). on ( MyCustomEvent . class , ( ctx , event ) -> { System . err . println ( \"Hello World\" ); }); Important Plugins should use the on method inherited from GeyserPlugin . This method takes 2 optional parameters specifying the priority of the event and if the handler should ignore cancelled events. Event Context \u00b6 The event handler receives an EventContext in addition to the Event class. The EventContext holds anything related to the EventHandler itself and presently only allows an EventHandler to unregister itself. Events \u00b6 Geyser has the following predefined Events. DisableEvent \u00b6 Triggered when a Plugin is disabled. EnableEvent \u00b6 cancellable Triggered when a Plugin is enabled. If cancelled then the plugin will be unloaded and no DisableEvent will be triggered.","title":"Events"},{"location":"events/#events","text":"Geyser has an Event Manager that allows one to listen to or trigger an event easily.

Plugins provide a way to extend the features of Geyser without needing to deal with the Geyser code. It is hoped that developers will be able to create plugins that would be of use to others. This page describes how to write a plugin. Maven \u00b6 Add the following to the relevant section of your pom.xml <repositories> <!-- Bundabrg's Repo --> <repository> <id> bundabrg-repo </id> <url> https://repo.worldguard.com.au/repository/maven-public </url> <releases> <enabled> true </enabled> </releases> <snapshots> <enabled> true </enabled> </snapshots> </repository> </repositories> <dependencies> <!-- Geyser --> <dependency> <groupId> org.geysermc </groupId> <artifactId> connector </artifactId> <version> 1.0-SNAPSHOT </version> <scope> provided </scope> </dependency> </dependencies> Info Plugin support is presently only available through a feature branch and thus there will be references to a third party maven repository that holds a build of this branch. This will change in the future. Example Plugin \u00b6 @Plugin ( name = \"ExamplePlugin\" , version = \"1.1.0-dev\" , authors = { \"bundabrg\" }, description = \"Provides an example plugin\" ) public class MyPlugin extends GeyserPlugin { public MyPlugin ( PluginManager pluginManager , PluginClassLoader pluginClassLoader ) { super ( pluginManager , pluginClassLoader ); } @Event public void onEnable ( EventContext ctx , EnableEvent event ) { System . err . println ( \"I'm alive\" ); // Register another class with event handlers registerEvents ( new MyAdditionalClass ()); // Example of lambda event hook on ( DisableEvent . class , ( ctx , event ) -> { System . err . println ( \"I'm also dead\" ); }, PRIORITY . HIGH ); } @Event public void onDisable ( EventContext ctx , DisableEvent event ) { System . err . println ( \"I'm dead\" ); } } Plugin EntryPoint \u00b6 A plugin must at a minimum define a class that extends GeyserPlugin and be annotated with @Plugin . The annotation provides details about the plugin such as its version and author(s). The following fields are available for @Plugin : name - Name of the plugin. Used in the logs. version - Version of the plugin. authors - A list of authors description - A short description of the plugin global - Should the plugin make its classes available to other plugins (default: true) Plugin Events \u00b6 A plugin will generally hook into several events and provides its own event registration inherited from GeyserPlugin . A plugin class will look for any methods annotated with @Event and will treat them as Event Handlers, using reflection to determine which event is being trapped. In the previous example the plugin has trapped both the EnableEvent and DisableEvent . Please refer to events for more information about the event system. Note There is no need to register the plugin class for events as it will be registered by default. Note The plugin class itself provides many of the registration methods found in the Event Manager to track which events belong to the plugin. You should use the plugins own registration methods in preference to those in the Event Manger.
