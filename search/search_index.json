Events can be easily defined either by defining a method to be an event handler or by providing a lambda. Each event handler will be executed in turn based upon their priority. Triggering an Event \u00b6 An event derives from GeyserEvent and can implement Cancellable if it should support being cancelled, and Session if it should support a GeyserSession . Example public class MyCustomEvent extends GeyserEvent implements Cancellable { } The event can be triggered through the triggerEvent method of the EventManager . Example EventManager . getInstance (). triggerEvent ( new MyCustomEvent ()); This returns an EventResult which can be used to chain additional commands based upon the result. They include onNotCancelled() , onCancelled() and orElse() to more easily execute based upon the result. All methods can be chained together. Example EventManager . getInstance (). triggerEvent ( new MyCustomEvent ()) . onNotCancelled ( result -> { // Code executed if events were not cancelled }) . orElse (( result ) -> { // Code executed if the above condition was not satisfied }); Example EventResult < MyCustomEvent > result = EventManager . getInstance (). triggerEvent ( new MyCustomEvent ()); if ( ! result . isCancelled ()) { // do something } Listening to an Event \u00b6 There are two ways to listen for an event. One can either create an event handler method or one can create an anonymous lamda to be executed when the event is triggered. Class Event Handler \u00b6 An event handler method is a method that is annotated with @GeyserEventHandler . The class it belongs to must also be registered with the event manager. Example public class MyClass { @Event public void onMyEvent ( MyCustomEvent event ) { GeyserConnector . getInstance (). getLogger (). info ( \"Hello World\" ); } } ... EventManager (). getInstance (). registerEvents ( new MyClass ()); Important Plugins should use the registerEvents method inherited from GeyserPlugin . MyCustomEvent is the event defined previously. Anonymous Lambda \u00b6 An event can be hooked through the on method of the EventManager provided with an anonymous function. This allows code to be placed logically close to where it is related in the code instead of having to set up a separate class and method listeners. You will need to remember to unregister an event handler when needed. Example EventHandler < MyCustomEvent > handler = EventManager . getInstance (). on ( MyCustomEvent . class , event -> { System . err . println ( \"Hello World\" ); }) . build (); Important Plugins should use the on method inherited from GeyserPlugin . You'll note the build() on the end. on() returns a Builder that can add optional parameters. This must be finalized with a build() that generates the EventHandler and registers it with the EventManager. The following additional parameters are available: priority(int) - Set the event priority. Default EventHandler.PRIORITY.NORMAL ignoreCancelled(boolean) - If true the handler will not execute if cancelled. Default true . Example EventHandler < MyCustomEvent > handler = EventManager . getInstance (). on ( MyCustomEvent . class , event -> { System . err . println ( \"Hello World\" ); }) . priority ( 30 ) . ignoreCancelled ( false ) . build (); Events \u00b6 Please refer to the API Docs for more information.

Plugins provide a way to extend the features of Geyser without needing to deal with the Geyser code. This page describes how to write a plugin. Alert Please keep in mind that Geyser itself may run as a plugin to a server or standalone. If you wish to have your plugin supported by a wide audience try to write it as if it runs on the standalone version of Geyser and thus does not have access to the server code. For example don't assume you can access the Spigot API unless you wish to limit your plugin to run only on Geyser running as a Spigot plugin. Maven \u00b6 Add the following to the relevant section of your pom.xml <repositories> <!-- Bundabrg's Repo --> <repository> <id> bundabrg-repo </id> <url> https://repo.worldguard.com.au/repository/maven-public </url> <releases> <enabled> true </enabled> </releases> <snapshots> <enabled> true </enabled> </snapshots> </repository> </repositories> <dependencies> <!-- Geyser --> <dependency> <groupId> org.geysermc </groupId> <artifactId> connector </artifactId> <version> 1.1.0-SNAPSHOT </version> <scope> provided </scope> </dependency> </dependencies> Info Plugin support is presently only available through a feature branch and thus there will be references to a third party maven repository that holds a build of this branch. This will change in the future. Example Plugin \u00b6 @Plugin ( name = \"ExamplePlugin\" , version = \"1.1.0-dev\" , authors = { \"bundabrg\" }, description = \"Provides an example plugin\" ) public class MyPlugin extends GeyserPlugin { public MyPlugin ( PluginManager pluginManager , PluginClassLoader pluginClassLoader ) { super ( pluginManager , pluginClassLoader ); } @GeyserEventHandler public void onStartup ( GeyserStartEvent event ) { System . err . println ( \"I'm alive\" ); // Register another class with event handlers registerEvents ( new MyAdditionalClass ()); // Example of lambda event hook EventHandler < GeyserStopEvent > handler = on ( GeyserStopEvent . class , event -> { System . err . println ( \"I'm also dead\" ); }) . priority ( EventHandler . PRIORITY . HIGH ) . build (); } @GeyserEventHandler public void onDisable ( GeyserStopEvent event ) { System . err . println ( \"I'm dead\" ); } } Plugin EntryPoint \u00b6 A plugin must at a minimum define a class that extends GeyserPlugin and be annotated with @Plugin . The annotation provides details about the plugin such as its version and author(s). The following fields are available for @Plugin : name - Name of the plugin. Used in the logs. version - Version of the plugin. authors - A list of authors description - A short description of the plugin global - Should the plugin make its classes available to other plugins (default: true) Plugin Events \u00b6 A plugin will generally hook into several events and provides its own event registration inherited from GeyserPlugin . A plugin class will look for any methods annotated with @GeyserEventHandler and will treat them as Event Handlers, using reflection to determine which event is trapped. In the previous example the plugin has trapped both the GeyserStartEvent and GeyserStopEvent . Please refer to events for more information about the event system. Note There is no need to register the plugin class for events as it will be registered by default. Note The plugin class itself provides many of the registration methods found in the Event Manager to track which events belong to the plugin. You should use the plugins own registration methods in preference to those in the Event Manger. This includes registerEvents and on . Plugin Messages \u00b6 A plugin can communicate with a plugin on the downstream server through the use of plugin message channels. More information about this can be found here . Sending a Plugin Message \u00b6 To send a plugin message use GeyserSession#sendPluginMessage. Example ByteArrayDataOutput out = ByteStreams . newDataOutput (); out . writeUTF ( \"Data1\" ); out . writeUTF ( \"Data2\" ); session . sendPluginMessage ( \"myplugin:channel\" , out . toByteArray ()); Receiving Plugin Messages \u00b6 To receive plugin messages you need to first register to receive the message then listen for the PluginMessageEvent . Example GeyserConnector . getInstance (). registerPluginChannel ( \"myplugin:channelname\" ); ''' @Event void public onPluginMessageEvent ( PluginMessageEvent event ) { if ( ! event . getChannel (). equals ( \"myplugin:channelname\" )) { return ; } ... } Logging \u00b6 Plugin classes use their getLogger() to retrieve a logging interface. This will log messages to the regular log with the plugin name prefixed in the messages.
